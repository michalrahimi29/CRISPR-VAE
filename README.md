    CRISPR-VAE: A Method for Explaining CRISPR/Cas12a Predictions, <br>
    and an Efficiency-aware gRNA Sequence Generator
</h1>
CRISPR-VAE aims to enhance the interpretability of gRNA efficiency predictions by creating a structured latent space. This space places similar sequences in proximity, allowing for smooth transitions between different sequence phenomena and facilitating better understanding and optimization of gRNA designs.
